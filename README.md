# USD-KZT-exchange-rate-forecasting-with-deep-learning
A course project on  USD/KZT currency pair exchange rate forecasting for CSCI-594 Deep Learning course at Nazarbayev University, Fall 2019.


Financial time series prediction using deep neural networks can be regarded as one of the most challenging applications of modern time series forecasting. Popular statistical model ARIMA can be considered as a benchmark when checking the performance of deep learning models in most of the cases. 

Deep learning models such as MLP, CNN, BiLSTM, CNN+LSTM are applied for forecasting the USD/KZT exchange pair. It was discovered that CNN+LSTM works best for time series forecasting compared to other deep neural networks. Crude oil price was implemented on selected deep learning models, to illustrate the effect of oil price on the USD/KZT exchange pair.
